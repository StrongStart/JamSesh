A band member can create a profile and go to "Create Group" to make a posting. There they can include the details of who they're looking for. The location input will suggest nearby known addresses to ensure correct display of address. Once created, the posting will show up on the homepage on the map and with the details below.

### Live Jam

Once each user who wants to Live Jam has an account, simply go to Live Jam and click the name of the other user to open live video chat where you can jam together.
